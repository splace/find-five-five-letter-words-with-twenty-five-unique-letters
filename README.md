# find-five-five-letter-words-with-twenty-five-unique-letters
Can you find: five five-letter words with twenty-five unique letters? from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-AfhLQfb6w

runs for me in just over a minute (parallel implementation)

used word list not great, dispite claims, it contains many non-wordle words.

could use cpu simd instructions. (AVX-512 should bacisally be 16x faster so 5 seconds?)

not a low order solution, many more words would make it slow.
